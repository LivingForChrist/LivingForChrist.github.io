Reading the Bible can be a deeply rewarding experience—but if you have ADHD, it may also feel overwhelming at times. Difficulty focusing, distractions, and mental fatigue can all make it hard to stay engaged with long or complex passages. But don't worry—you're not alone, and there *are* ways to connect with God's Word that work with your brain, not against it.

Here are some practical tips to help you read your Bible more effectively if you live with ADHD.

---

## 1. Start Small — And Stay Consistent

Reading the whole Bible in a year is a great goal, but it’s okay to start with smaller chunks. Even just **one verse a day** can be meaningful.

- Try reading a **short passage or a single psalm**.
- Use a **Bible app with verse-of-the-day notifications**.
- Keep a **sticky note** or **reminder** where you'll see it.

> 🕊️ Consistency is more important than quantity.

## 2. Use Audio Bibles

If your mind wanders when you read, **listen instead**. Audio Bibles are a game-changer for many with ADHD.

- Play the Bible while walking, driving, or doing chores.
- Follow along in a physical Bible as you listen.
- Try dramatic or musical versions if you need more engagement.

**Apps to try**: *YouVersion*, *Dwell*, *Bible Gateway*

## 3. Pick the Right Translation

Some translations are easier to understand and feel more conversational.

- Try the **NLT (New Living Translation)** or **CEV (Contemporary English Version)**.
- Avoid older or complex translations if they cause frustration (e.g., KJV).

> 🧠 Finding the right *voice* helps the words stick.

## 4. Make It Interactive

Don’t just read—**engage** with the text.

- Use **highlighters** or colored pens.
- Take **brief notes**, write questions, or draw doodles.
- Use **journaling Bibles** or print out verses to decorate.

> 🎨 The more senses involved, the more you'll retain.

## 5. Use a Timer (Pomodoro Style)

Try the **Pomodoro Technique**:  
Work (or in this case, read) for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.

- Set a timer for 5–15 minutes of Bible reading.
- When the timer goes off, stop. Even if you want more.
- This helps build habit without burnout.

## 6. Choose ADHD-Friendly Bible Plans

Some Bible reading plans are more structured and visually helpful.

- Use **checklists** or **apps** that track progress.
- Look for **topical plans** (e.g., anxiety, purpose, identity).
- Try **visual devotionals** with art or infographics.

> ✅ Shorter plans with a clear goal can keep your interest.

## 7. Find a Study Partner or Group

Accountability helps. Bible reading doesn’t have to be solo.

- Join a **small group**, **Discord server**, or **Bible app friend group**.
- Do a weekly check-in with a friend.
- Read aloud together on a call or voice message.

> 🤝 Having someone walk with you adds motivation and depth.

## 8. Don’t Be Afraid to Re-read

It’s totally okay to re-read the same chapter or verse.

- Repetition helps with memory and understanding.
- You might notice something new each time.
- God’s Word isn’t a race—it’s a relationship.

## 9. Be Kind to Yourself

Some days will be hard. You might skip reading, lose focus, or forget where you left off. That’s okay.

> “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” — *Romans 8:1*

God is patient. He meets you right where you are.

---

## 10. Invite God Into the Struggle

ADHD is a challenge, but it’s not a barrier to spiritual growth. Ask God for help focusing, understanding, and enjoying His Word.

- Pray a short prayer before you start:  
  _“Lord, help me focus and speak to me through Your Word today.”_

> ✨ He understands you fully—and He wants you close.

---

## Final Thoughts

You don’t need to be perfect or hyper-focused to connect with Scripture. The goal isn't to “get through” the Bible, but to let it get through to you.

Whether you read one verse a day, listen while folding laundry, or doodle Bible verses in a notebook—**you’re building a spiritual habit that matters.**

Your brain is wonderfully made—and God’s Word is for *you*, just as you are.
